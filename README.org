* Fastest auto-completion using Company and Ctags

This library enables the completion using [[http://company-mode.github.io][Company mode]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags][Ctags]] for Emacs. It's *simply fast* because a new optimized algorithm is designed for Ctags.

It shows the candidate immediately for project as big as Linux kernel.

* Install and Setup
Place =company-ctags.el= under [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][Load Path]], then add =(require 'company-ctags)= to your configuration.

Itâ€™s also possible to use [[http://melpa.org/]].

Setup is simple,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load 'company
  '(progn
     (company-ctags-auto-setup)))
#+END_SRC
* Usage
Step 1, create tags file in project root,
#+begin_src sh
find . -name "*.[ch]" | ctags -e -L -
#+end_src

Step 2, enjoy!
* Tips
Make sure =diff-command= is executable on Windows. You might need install GNU Diff. It's used to speed up loading of updated tags file.

The program =diff= is optional but highly recommended.

Linux/macOS needs no setup.
